# 📱 Effingham Community Safety & Wellness App – INSY6212 Assignment 2

Welcome to the official GitHub Organization for the **Effingham Community Safety and Wellness App** conceptualised by **CommCare**. This project is being managed as part of our IT Project Management module at Varsity College, South Africa. Our aim is not to build the app, but to **project manage its full design, development, and deployment lifecycle** in line with professional industry standards.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Effingham Heights community currently faces communication challenges due to an over-reliance on a single WhatsApp group for all safety, health, and service-related matters. Critical updates often get buried under casual messages, posing risks especially to elderly or vulnerable residents.

Our proposed solution is a **dedicated mobile app** that consolidates real-time alerts, emergency contacts, and community features into a single, accessible platform.
